        <h2>Why Electric Vehicles?</h2>
        <img src="electric vechiles pic 1 .html.png" width="500px">
        <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing the way we think about transportation. By choosing an EV, you're not only helping the environment but also saving on long-term costs.Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity due to their environmental and economic benefits. They use electricity as their primary power source instead of fossil fuels, leading to zero tailpipe emissions and reduced greenhouse gases. EVs are energy-efficient, have lower operating costs, and require less maintenance compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. They also help reduce dependence on oil, promote renewable energy use, and contribute to cleaner air and healthier communities. Governments and companies are investing in EV infrastructure, making them more accessible and practical for everyday use.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero Emissions:</strong> No harmful tailpipe emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Operating Costs:</strong> Electricity is cheaper than gasoline, and EVs require less maintenance.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficient:</strong> EVs convert over 77% of energy into movement, compared to just 30% in gasoline vehicles.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Types of Electric Vehicles Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Types of Electric Vehicles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):</strong> Fully electric and powered by rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li><strong>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):</strong> Run on both electricity and gasoline for extended range.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs):</strong> Use an electric motor combined with a gasoline engine for better fuel efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color:black">Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):
            Fully electric vehicles that run solely on electric power stored in rechargeable batteries. They have no internal combustion engine.
            Examples: Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf
            
            Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):
            These have both an electric motor and a gasoline engine. They can run on electric power for short distances and switch to the gasoline engine for longer trips.
            Examples: Toyota Prius Prime, Chevrolet Volt
            
            Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs):
            HEVs use a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, but they cannot be plugged in. The battery is charged through regenerative braking and the engine.
            Examples: Toyota Prius, Honda Civic Hybrid
            
            Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs):
            FCEVs use hydrogen gas and oxygen to generate electricity through a fuel cell. They only emit water vapor and offer long driving ranges.
            Examples: Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo</p>

    <!-- Government Incentives Section -->
    <section class="section-background">
        <h2>Government Incentives and Policies</h2>
        <p>Many governments offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. These can help offset the initial costs of purchasing an EV.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tax Credits:</strong> Save up to $7,500 on your new EV.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Charger Rebates:</strong> Get support for installing an EV charging station at home.</li>
            <li><strong>Discounted Toll Fees:</strong> EV drivers may qualify for reduced or free tolls.</li>
